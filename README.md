RELATIONAL DATABASES

Create a flask application, in accordance with submittal guidelines (outlined in previous assignment), that contains the following:

    A main page or index explaining what relational databases are and what the difference are between them and "no sql" or "schema-less" relational databases (such as MongoDB, CouchDB, etc).
    A page that outlines SQL statements typically associated with CRUD operations.
        Give examples of the type of SQL statement that would typically be associated with creating a new resource (such as a new record in a database table).
        Give examples of the type of SQL statement that would typically be associated with reading or viewing a single record for read only purposes.
        Give examples of the type of SQL statement typically associated with updating a record.
        Give examples of the type of SQL statement typically associated with deleting a record.
        Give examples of how a scan operation might work in the context of SQL.
    Every example in the previous point must be accompanied with an explanation of what we know about the requested operation.
    An about the author page with the following:
        first name
        last name
        short blurb or bio
    Your project must use bootstrap and must contain at least a comprehensive navbar to access the pages outlined above.
