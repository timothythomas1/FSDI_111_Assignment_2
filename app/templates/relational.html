        <h1>SQL statements typically associated with CRUD operations</h1>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>C:</strong> Create</li>
        <p>INSERT INTO mytable(id, name) VALUES (12345, "Trevor");</p>
        <p>Create allows you to add new rows to your table. You can do that using the command, INSERT INTO. The command starts with the INSERT INTO keyword, followed by the table name, column names, and the values to be inserted.</p>
        <li><strong>R:</strong> Read</li>
        <p>SELECT * FROM mytable WHERE id=1;   </p>
        <p>The read function is similar to a search function, as it allows you to retrieve specific records and read their values using the SELECT keyword.</p>
        <li><strong>U:</strong> Update</li>
        <p>UPDATE TABLE mytable SET name=”X” WHERE id=1;</p>
        <p>Update is how we change an existing record in the table. We can use this to modify existing records that exist in the database. When performing UPDATE, you need to define the target table and columns to be updated. You also need the associated values and sometimes the rows.</p>
        <p>*It is recommended to limit the number of rows, as this helps to avoid concurrency issues.
        </p>
        <li><strong>D:</strong> Delete</li>
        <p>DELETE FROM mytable WHERE id=1;   </p>
        <p>Delete is used to remove a record from the table. SQL and has a built-in delete function for deleting one or more records from the database at a time. Some relational database applications may permit a hard delete (permanent delete) or soft delete (update row status).</p>
        <p>If you want to delete all the records from the table, you can use:</p>
        <p>DELETE FROM table;</p>
        <li>Scan*</li>
        <p>SELECT * FROM mytable; </p>
        <p>* = no pagination</p>
    </ul>
